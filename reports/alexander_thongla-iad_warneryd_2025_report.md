<!-- 4. Summary of Key Findings -->
<h1>4. Summary of Key Findings</h1>

<div style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6;">

<h2>✅ Strengths</h3>
  <ul style="margin-top: 4px; padding-left: 18px;">
    <li><strong>🔁 Dribbling:</strong> <strong>4.70</strong> successful dribbles per 90 minutes (<strong>80% success</strong>) – strong 1v1 ability and confidence on the ball.</li>
    <li><strong>📩 Crossing:</strong> <strong>50.80% accuracy</strong> – outstanding delivery into the box; elite numbers.</li>
    <li><strong>🎯 Key Passes:</strong> 1.91 per 90 – consistently involved in creating chances.</li>
    <li><strong>🎯 Pass Accuracy:</strong> 78.40% – reliable distribution, especially in attacking zones.</li>
    <li><strong>🎁 Chance Creation:</strong> Despite a modest 0.16 big chances created per 90, his assist count (6) and creative metrics suggest strong impact in chance generation.</li>
    <li><strong>🛡️ Interceptions:</strong> 1.20 per 90 – indicates good anticipation, positioning and reading of play when out of possession.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>⚠️ Weaknesses & Limitations</h3>
  <ul style="margin-top: 4px; padding-left: 18px;">
    <li><strong>🚫 Clearances:</strong> 0 – shows limited involvement in deep defensive actions; may reflect tactical positioning - in a 3-5-2 system he usually stays higher or defends space rather than the box.</li>
    <li><strong>🪂 Aerial Duels Won:</strong> 0.24 per 90 – weak aerial contribution, likely due to his 1.74m height and physical profile.</li>
    <li><strong>🧱 Defensive Output:</strong> Other defensive stats are unremarkable, suggesting limited contribution when defending deep or in 1v1 duels.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>🧐 Stats Requiring Context</h3>
  <ul style="margin-top: 4px; padding-left: 18px;">
    <li><strong>🚷 Blocked Shots:</strong> 0.48 per 90 – not necessarily low for his role; depends on tactical shape and positioning.</li>
    <li><strong>🕴️ Dribbled Past:</strong> 0.64 per 90 – moderate value; not worrying on its own, but worth tracking depending on matchups and pressure situations.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>📌 Tactical Fit Insight</h3>
<p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 4px;">
  While his defensive weaknesses are notable, they can be tactically compensated when paired with a defensively solid right-sided centre-back in a back three. His profile is best suited to systems with wing-backs (e.g., 3-5-2 or 3-4-3), where he can focus on attacking transitions and wide creativity. 
  <strong>He may struggle as a full-back in a traditional back four</strong>, where more defensive reliability is expected. In such systems, an alternative could be testing him as an <strong>inverted left winger</strong>, where his technical ability and creativity can be maximized in tighter spaces.

<h1>8. Conclusion</h1>
<div style="font-size: 14px; color: #333; line-height: 1.6;">

  <p>
    Alexander Thongla-Iad Warneryd emerges as a highly dynamic wide player with standout attacking contribution and technical consistency in the final third. His profile is shaped by elite-level metrics in <strong>dribbling (4.70 per 90)</strong>, <strong>crossing accuracy (50.8%)</strong>, and <strong>key passes (1.91 per 90)</strong>, all of which point toward a player capable of regularly creating high-quality chances — as reflected in his <strong>6 assists</strong> and a positive <strong>Assists-xA delta (+2.83)</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Defensively, however, his numbers are much more limited. His <strong>0 clearances</strong>, <strong>low aerial duel success (0.24 per 90)</strong>, and modest <strong>defensive volume stats</strong> suggest that he would likely struggle as a traditional full-back in a back four. That said, he could be tactically optimized in a <strong>right wing-back role in a 3-5-2</strong>, especially when covered by a defensively solid right-sided centre-back. In systems like these, his weaknesses can be masked, and his offensive upside can be maximized.
  </p>

  <p>
    At just <strong>19 years old</strong>, with dual nationality (🇸🇪 Swedish & 🇹🇭 Thai), and already contributing at a high level in the Superettan, his current market value of <strong>€1.00M</strong> appears justified — and potentially undervalued if development continues at this rate. Alexander should be considered a high-upside profile for clubs looking to invest in vertical, creative wide players with room to grow — particularly in systems that allow him the freedom to push forward and focus on his final-third impact.
